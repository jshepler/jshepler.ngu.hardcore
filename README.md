# jshepler.ngu.hardcore (beta)

A mod for NGU Idle that adds hardcore mode. If you die, game over.
 - ***requires starting a new game - you cannot enable hardcore on an existing save***
 - ***requires using steam cloud***
 - steam cloud is the only save allowed to load - all others methods of loading saves are disabled
 - if you die, cloud save is deleted and you are shown a GAME OVER screen and can do nothing but exit and start over
 - for now, you can still create saves - if you run into an error, send me the latest save before the error
 - *(creating local saves, including auto and backups saves, will be disabled with 1.0 release)*

I can't think of any required player deaths that need an exception. Some have suggested maybe T4 and T10 require the player to die, but they do not. If anyone can think of any exceptions that are needed or if you encounter something that needs an exception, let me know.

    The only requirement for Ring of Apathy to drop is beating boss 100 in current rebirth (or already having it dropped). The only thing you get from T4 is the clue text in the combat log.

    GLOP is not needed to unlock or autokill T10. Getting 5 kills is OPTIONAL. If you have the AK stats, that's all you need.

**This mod cannot be used with the [mod pack](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.mods)**. The mod pack will have hardcore mode and this mod will conflict with that, so this mod will not load if the pack is loaded. If you wish to start using the mod pack after starting an HC save, remove this mod and add the pack. **Make sure to edit the pack's cfg file and enable Hardcore BEFORE loading the save.**

# Installation

If you already have bepinex installed, then you only need to download the `jshepler.ngu.hardcore.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.hardcore/releases/latest).

If not, follow the install directions for the [mod pack](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.mods), but instead of downloading the `jshepler.ngu.mods.dll` file, download the `jshepler.ngu.hardcore.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.hardcore/releases/latest).
